  * BoundingBox class and getBoundingBox functions for Shape objects
  * Implemented contains method of class ComplexShape
  * Pivot/origin is automatically set to center of bounding box of ComplexShapes
  * paused property to Avatar class (suspend animation updating)

  * Function resetTransform of ComplexShape class
  * Function invalidateBoundingBox of ComplexShape
  * Function getRootShape of ComplexShape class (needed by function "invalidateBoundingBox")
  * Getter and setter function for the pre-transform matrix of ComplexShape instances
  * Removed time function "TFConstant" (redundant with manual softTransform)
